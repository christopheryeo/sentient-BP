# V0.2.3 - Founder Slide Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design specifications for the founder slide update, focusing on the inclusion of Christopher Yeo's photo.

## Design Details

### 1. Image Sourcing and Optimization
- **Source**: A high-quality, professional headshot of Christopher Yeo. The existing image `chris-yeo.png` in `static/images/` should be evaluated. If it's not suitable, a new one should be sourced.
- **Optimization**: The image must be optimized for web use to ensure fast loading times without sacrificing quality. This includes:
    - Compression (lossless or minimal lossy).
    - Appropriate file format (e.g., PNG for transparency if needed, otherwise JPEG for photos).
    - Resizing to the dimensions it will be displayed at.

### 2. Sizing and Placement
- **Sizing**: The image should be sized appropriately to fit within the existing slide layout. It should be prominent but not overpowering. Specific dimensions will depend on the final slide design, but it should be clear and easily recognizable.
- **Placement**: The photo should be strategically placed on the founder slide. Common placements include:
    - Top-left or top-right corner, alongside text.
    - Centered if it's the main focus of the slide with minimal text.
    - Integrated into a dedicated "About the Founder" section.
    - Consistency with other profile images in the presentation (if any) should be maintained.

### 3. Styling and Border
- **Styling**:
    - The image should have a clean and professional look.
    - Consider a subtle shadow or rounded corners if it aligns with the overall presentation aesthetic.
    - Ensure the styling is consistent with the brand guidelines.
- **Border**:
    - A thin, unobtrusive border can be added to frame the photo and make it stand out slightly from the background.
    - Border color should complement the slide's color scheme.

### 4. Accessibility
- **Alt Text**: Meaningful alt text must be provided for the image. For example: "Headshot of Christopher Yeo, Founder and CEO of Sentient.io". This is crucial for users with visual impairments using screen readers.

## Mockups/Sketches

*(Placeholder for visual mockups or sketches of the founder slide with the new photo. This section would typically include low-fidelity wireframes or high-fidelity mockups showing the image in context.)*

## Design Considerations
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure the image and slide layout are responsive and look good on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Consistency**: The design should be consistent with the overall look and feel of the presentation.
- **Clarity**: The photo should be clear, well-lit, and professional.
