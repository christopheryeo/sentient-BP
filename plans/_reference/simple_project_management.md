# Simple Project Management

All development happens directly in `plans/Versions/`. Each version folder (e.g., `plans/Versions/V0.2.6/`) contains its planning guides, tasks, and release notes.

When a new version begins, create its folder inside `plans/Versions/` and track everything there. Completed versions remain in this directory for reference.

The old `0_backlog/` and `1_planning/` directories are no longer used.
