## 2. Do the files do_plan.md and create_version.md read information from the file questions.md?

Yes, both `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` extensively interact with `questions.md` as follows:

### In do_plan.md:
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Requires pre-populated `questions.md` with version information
   - Loads and parses YAML configuration from `questions.md`
   - Creates a default `questions.md` if missing

2. **Execution**
   - Uses answers from `questions.md` during version creation
   - Validates all required information is present in `questions.md`
   - Verifies `questions.md` is complete before execution

3. **Pre-requisites**
   - `questions.md` must be fully populated before execution
   - Used as the single source of truth for version configuration

### In create_version.md:
1. **Default Values**
   - Reads values from `questions.md` as defaults
   - Uses these values throughout the version creation process

2. **Documentation**
   - Updates files like `design.md` with specifications from `questions.md`
   - Uses team member information from `questions.md`

3. **Automation**
   - Gathers required information from `questions.md` and `ROADMAP.md`
   - Uses values from `questions.md` as defaults throughout the process

### Key Points:
- `questions.md` serves as the primary configuration file
- Both files require `questions.md` to be properly formatted and complete
- The file is used to maintain consistency across the version creation process
- Values from `questions.md` are used to populate various documentation files

## 3. What are the phases in create_version.md?

## 4. Are the tasks in tasks.md that create_version.md creates executed?

Yes, tasks in `tasks.md` are executed during Phase 3 (Implementation) of `create_version.md`. Here's how it works:

1. **Task Generation**
   - Tasks are automatically generated in `tasks.md` during earlier phases
   - Each task is tracked by status

2. **Task Execution**
   - Tasks are executed in the order they appear in `tasks.md`
   - The system updates task status upon completion
   - Progress is tracked in real-time

3. **Verification**
   - Code changes are verified against requirements
   - Automated tests are run for each task
   - Changes are committed with descriptive messages

4. **Status Updates**
   - Task status is updated in `tasks.md`
   - Overall progress is tracked in `status.md`
   - Any issues are logged in `version_creation.log`

5. **Automation**
   - Task execution is fully automated
   - No manual intervention is required
   - The system handles errors and rollbacks if needed

This ensures that all tasks are executed in a controlled and verifiable manner.

## 5. Is the first task to be executed the one that lists all code that will be changed by the subsequent tasks?

Yes, the first task in the implementation phase is designed to analyze and document all required code changes. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Analysis**: The first task performs a comprehensive analysis of the codebase to identify all necessary changes
2. **Documentation**: It documents the analysis results, including:
   - Files requiring modification
   - Specific changes needed
   - Dependencies and impacts
3. **Task Generation**: Based on this analysis, it generates specific implementation tasks that will be executed in sequence

This approach ensures all code changes are properly planned and documented before implementation begins, providing a clear roadmap for the development process.

## 6. Can do_plan.md and create_version.md be executed by the AI without stopping for human approval or responses?

Yes, both `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` are designed to run automatically without requiring human intervention, provided that all prerequisites are met. Here's how automated execution works:

### Automated Execution Flow
1. **Pre-requisites**:
   - `questions.md` must be fully populated with required information
   - `ROADMAP.md` must exist and be accessible
   - Git must be properly initialized and configured
   - Required permissions for file operations must be set

2. **Non-Interactive Operation**:
   - Both files are designed to run without interactive input
   - All decisions are made based on the configuration in `questions.md`
   - Error conditions are handled automatically with appropriate logging

3. **Phase-based Execution**:
   - `create_version.md` follows a strict phase-based approach
   - Each phase validates its own requirements before proceeding
   - Status is tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Progress is logged for monitoring

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Non-critical issues are logged and execution continues
   - Critical errors stop execution and log detailed error information
   - Error recovery processes are built into each phase

5. **Logging and Status**:
   - All operations are logged for audit purposes
   - Status is tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Learnings are captured in `learn.log` for continuous improvement

This fully automated approach ensures consistent and reliable version management while eliminating the need for manual intervention during execution.

## 7. Where are run.log and learn.log used for logging in do_plan.md and create_version.md?
