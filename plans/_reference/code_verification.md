## 2. Do the files do_plan.md and create_version.md read information from the file questions.md?

Yes, both `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` extensively interact with `questions.md` as follows:

### In do_plan.md:
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Requires pre-populated `questions.md` with version information
   - Loads and parses YAML configuration from `questions.md`
   - Creates a default `questions.md` if missing

2. **Execution**
   - Uses answers from `questions.md` during version creation
   - Validates all required information is present in `questions.md`
   - Verifies `questions.md` is complete before execution

3. **Pre-requisites**
   - `questions.md` must be fully populated before execution
   - Used as the single source of truth for version configuration

### In create_version.md:
1. **Default Values**
   - Reads values from `questions.md` as defaults
   - Uses these values throughout the version creation process

2. **Documentation**
   - Updates files like `TECH_SPEC.md` with specifications from `questions.md`
   - Uses team member information from `questions.md`

3. **Automation**
   - Gathers required information from `questions.md` and `ROADMAP.md`
   - Uses values from `questions.md` as defaults throughout the process

### Key Points:
- `questions.md` serves as the primary configuration file
- Both files require `questions.md` to be properly formatted and complete
- The file is used to maintain consistency across the version creation process
- Values from `questions.md` are used to populate various documentation files

## 3. What are the phases in create_version.md?

`create_version.md` contains the following 7 phases, with detailed workflows for the first 6:

1. **Phase 1: Comprehensive Planning & Design (Automated)**

Each phase includes:
- Automatic verification checks
- Required file updates
- Progress tracking in TASKS.md
- Learning capture for continuous improvement
- Integration with version control
- Automated logging to learn.log

## 4. Are the tasks in tasks.md that create_version.md creates executed?

Yes, tasks in `tasks.md` are executed during Phase 3 (Implementation) of `create_version.md`. Here's how it works:

1. **Task Generation**
   - Tasks are automatically generated in `TASKS.md` during earlier phases
   - Each task is tracked by status
   - Tasks reference requirements and specifications in `TECH_SPEC.md`

2. **Task Execution**
   - Tasks are executed in the order they appear in `tasks.md`
   - The system updates task status upon completion
   - Progress is tracked in real-time

3. **Verification**
   - Code changes are verified against requirements
   - Automated tests are run for each task
   - Changes are committed with descriptive messages

4. **Status and Logging**
   - Task status and overall progress are tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Execution details and issues are logged in `learn.log`
   - Both files are updated in real-time during execution

5. **Automation**
   - Task execution is fully automated
   - No manual intervention is required
   - The system handles errors and rollbacks if needed

This ensures that all tasks are executed in a controlled and verifiable manner.

## 5. Is the first task to be executed the one that lists all code that will be changed by the subsequent tasks?

Yes, the first task in the implementation phase is designed to analyze and document all required code changes. Here's how it works:

1. **Initial Analysis**: The first task performs a comprehensive analysis of the codebase to identify all necessary changes
2. **Documentation**: It documents the analysis results, including:
   - Files requiring modification
   - Specific changes needed
   - Dependencies and impacts
3. **Task Generation**: Based on this analysis, it generates specific implementation tasks that will be executed in sequence

This approach ensures all code changes are properly planned and documented before implementation begins, providing a clear roadmap for the development process.

## 6. Can do_plan.md and create_version.md be executed by the AI without stopping for human approval or responses?

Yes, both `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` are designed to run automatically without requiring human intervention, provided that all prerequisites are met. Here's how automated execution works:

### Automated Execution Flow
1. **Pre-requisites**:
   - `questions.md` must be fully populated with required information
   - `ROADMAP.md` must exist and be accessible
   - Git must be properly initialized and configured
   - Required permissions for file operations must be set

2. **Non-Interactive Operation**:
   - Both files are designed to run without interactive input
   - All decisions are made based on the configuration in `questions.md`
   - Error conditions are handled automatically with appropriate logging

3. **Phase-based Execution**:
   - `create_version.md` follows a strict phase-based approach
   - Each phase validates its own requirements before proceeding
   - Status is tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Progress is logged for monitoring

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Non-critical issues are logged and execution continues
   - Critical errors stop execution and log detailed error information
   - Error recovery processes are built into each phase

5. **Logging and Status**:
   - All operations are logged for audit purposes
   - Status is tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Learnings are captured in `learn.log` for continuous improvement

This fully automated approach ensures consistent and reliable version management while eliminating the need for manual intervention during execution.

## 7. Where are run.log and learn.log used for logging in do_plan.md and create_version.md?

### learn.log Usage:

1. **In do_plan.md**:
   - Used to document key learnings during execution
   - Captured in the "Update Project Files" phase

2. **In create_version.md**:
   - Automatically captures learnings throughout the version creation process
   - Used to store insights and improvements from each phase
   - Referenced in multiple phases to maintain context:
     - Phase 2: Appends Phase 1's planning learnings
     - Phase 4: Appends Phase 4's implementation learnings
     - Phase 5: Appends Phase 5's testing learnings
     - Phase 6: Appends final learnings (not phase-specific)
   - Previous phases' learnings are automatically inserted from learn.log in each phase

### run.log Usage:

`run.log` is planned for implementation and is referenced in both templates:

1. **In do_plan.md**:
   - Will log detailed errors during execution
   - Will track all actions with timestamps
   - Will record completion status of operations
   - Described as "Complete execution log with timestamps"

2. **In create_version.md**:
   - Will log all AI interactions with [AI] prefix
   - Will contain all logs with timestamps
   - Will serve as a centralized logging system

### Implementation Notes:
- `learn.log` is actively used for continuous improvement
- `run.log` is consistently referenced as a "planned feature" in both templates
- Both logs are designed to support the automated execution and learning cycle
- The logs help maintain context between different phases of execution


## 8. Are the files mentioned in Q1 the only ones created by do_plan.md and create_version.md?

No, `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` create additional files beyond those listed in Q1. Here's a comprehensive list of all files and directories created by the templates:

1. **Files Listed in Q1**
   - `VERSION_PLAN.md` - Version overview and objectives
   - `TASKS.md` - Task tracking and assignments
   - `TECH_SPEC.md` - Technical specifications and architecture
   - `RELEASE_NOTES.md` - Release information and changes
   - `docs/` - Directory for additional documentation and assets
   - `questions.md` - Version configuration and parameters
   - `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions (if configured)
   - `run.log` - Execution logs and runtime information (planned)
   - `learn.log` - Records learnings and insights from execution

2. **Additional Files Created**
   - A version-specific copy of `create_version.md` in the version directory
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history and changes (mentioned in Q1 under Version Control)
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration (mentioned in Q1 under Version Control)

3. **Files Generated During Execution**
   - Testing results directory: `testing/results/` (created during Phase 5)
   - Various reports and documentation in the `docs/` directory

The templates are designed to primarily work with the files listed in Q1, but they do create or modify additional files as needed during the version creation process. The core functionality and main outputs are captured in the Q1 file list, but the complete set of files affected is broader.

## 9. Which files are referenced in the workflow but not created by do_plan.md or create_version.md?

The following files are referenced in the workflow but not created by either `do_plan.md` or `create_version.md`:

### Project Files Referenced But Not Created:
1. `ROADMAP.md` - Referenced extensively for version planning and status tracking
2. `content/Style.md` - Referenced for McKinsey presentation standards and styling guidelines
3. The template files themselves:
   - `plans/_templates/create_version.md` - Referenced and copied, but the original template is not created
   - `plans/_templates/questions.md` - Referenced and potentially copied if not existing

### Clarification on Other Files:
- `questions.md` in the version directory may be created if not existing, or referenced if already present
- `CHANGELOG.md` is referenced and updated but may also be created if not existing
- Core documentation files (`VERSION_PLAN.md`, `TASKS.md`, etc.) are created by the templates, not just referenced

## 10. How does the learning and reflection mechanism work across phases in create_version.md?

`create_version.md` implements a continuous learning cycle across all phases:

1. **Learning at the End of Each Phase**:
   - Each phase includes a "Learning & Reflection" section
   - Learnings are saved to `learn.log`
   - Structured format includes:
     - What Went Well
     - Challenges Faced
     - Key Insights

2. **Reading Learnings at Phase Start**:
   - Each phase after the first includes a "Learning from Previous Phases" section
   - References reading from `learn.log`
   - Placeholder: `[Previous phases' learnings will be automatically inserted here from learn.log]`

3. **Automated File Updates**:
   - Each phase's "File Updates" section includes appending to `learn.log`
   - Example: `Append Phase X learnings to learn.log`

4. **Consistent Structure**:
   - All six phases follow this pattern
   - Ensures continuous learning and improvement
   - Creates a feedback loop between phases

5. **Implementation**:
   - Learnings are timestamped and categorized by phase
   - The system maintains a running log in `learn.log`
   - Each phase builds upon learnings from previous ones

This mechanism ensures knowledge is captured, stored, and applied throughout the version management process, creating a continuous improvement cycle.

### Integration Files:
1. `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions
2. `run.log` - Runtime execution logs (when implemented)
3. `learn.log` - Learning and improvement logs
8. `run.log` - Runtime execution logs (when implemented)
9. `learn.log` - Learning and improvement logs

These files are either read from or written to during the version creation process but are not created by the main workflow scripts. They are expected to exist in their respective locations as part of the project structure.

**Note**: The workflow strictly adheres to the file creation policy defined in Q1, only creating or modifying the explicitly listed files. All other files are treated as read-only or append-only for logging purposes.
