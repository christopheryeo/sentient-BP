## 2. What are the phases in create_version.md?


`create_version.md` outlines a four-phase workflow from planning through finalization:

1. **Phase 1: Comprehensive Planning & Design (Automated)**
   - Version information extraction from ROADMAP.md
   - Standard files setup in the version directory
   - Automated task checklist generation within VERSION_PLAN.md
   - Validation of requirements and dependencies

2. **Phase 2: Development Kickoff**
   - Milestone review and validation
   - Team assignments from the configuration file
   - Development environment verification
   - Documentation of development standards

3. **Phase 3: Iterative Feature Development & Implementation**
   - Code impact analysis with granular task creation
   - Implementation of tasks tracked in VERSION_PLAN.md
   - HTML and JavaScript updates for slides
   - Verification of slide architecture and navigation

4. **Phase 4: Holistic Review, Testing, Documentation & Finalization**
   - Comprehensive code review and testing
   - Batch update of documentation and release notes
   - Final validation of HTML structure and navigation
   - Updating ROADMAP.md and CHANGELOG.md

Each phase includes:
- Required file updates
- Progress tracking in VERSION_PLAN.md
- Documentation updates

## 3. Are the tasks tracked in VERSION_PLAN.md executed?

Yes, tasks in the checklist within `VERSION_PLAN.md` are executed during Phase 3 (Implementation) of `create_version.md`. Here's how it works:

1. **Task Generation**
   - Tasks are defined in the checklist in `VERSION_PLAN.md` during earlier phases
   - Each task is tracked by status
   - Tasks reference requirements and specifications in `TECH_SPEC.md`

2. **Task Execution**
   - Tasks are executed in the order they appear in the checklist
   - Updates to task status are made upon completion
   - Progress is tracked throughout the implementation

3. **Verification**
   - Code changes are verified against requirements
   - Slide ID and numbering consistency is checked
   - Changes are committed with descriptive messages

4. **Status and Logging**
   - Task status and overall progress are tracked in `VERSION_PLAN.md`
   - Execution details are documented alongside the checklist
   - Progress is updated directly within `VERSION_PLAN.md`

5. **HTML Structure Verification**
   - Slide structure is verified for consistency
   - Navigation elements are tested
   - Image paths are checked for correctness

This ensures that all tasks are executed in a controlled and verifiable manner, focusing on the HTML application structure and content.

## 4. Is the first task to be executed the one that lists all code that will be changed by the subsequent tasks?

Yes, a critical early task, referred to as "Initial Code Analysis" (and specified as "Code Impact Analysis" in the template), performed during **Phase 1 (Comprehensive Planning & Design (Automated))** of `create_version.md`, is designed to analyze and document required code changes. This analysis task is part of the implementation phase as follows:

1.  **Initial Code Analysis / Code Impact Analysis**: This early task performs an analysis of the codebase to identify necessary changes specific to slide implementation, focusing on:
    *   HTML structure review
    *   Slide ID sequence verification
    *   Navigation button consistency
    *   Image path conventions

2.  **Documentation**: It documents the analysis results, including:
    *   Files requiring modification
    *   Specific changes needed
    *   Dependencies and impacts
    *   Slide architecture considerations

3.  **Task Generation**: Based on this analysis, the checklist in `VERSION_PLAN.md` is populated with granular tasks for the implementation phase, ensuring proper slide integration and consistency.

This approach ensures code changes are properly planned and documented before full implementation, providing a clear roadmap for the development process while focusing on the HTML-based slide architecture.

## 5. Can do_plan.md and create_version.md be executed by the AI without stopping for human approval or responses?

Yes, both `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` are designed to run automatically without requiring human intervention, provided that all prerequisites are met. Here's how automated execution works in the current implementation:

### Automated Execution Flow
1. **Pre-requisites**:
   - All required configuration values must be provided
   - `ROADMAP.md` must exist and be accessible
   - Required permissions for file operations must be set
   - HTML structure and slide architecture must be understood

2. **Non-Interactive Operation**:
   - Both files are designed to run without interactive input
   - All decisions are made based on predefined configuration
   - Error conditions are logged with appropriate messages
   - Focus is on HTML application modifications without deployment requirements

3. **Phase-based Execution**:
   - `create_version.md` follows a strict phase-based approach
   - Each phase validates its own requirements before proceeding
   - Status is tracked in `VERSION_PLAN.md`
   - Progress is logged for monitoring

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Non-critical issues are logged and execution continues
   - Critical errors stop execution and log detailed error information
   - Error recovery processes are built into each phase

5. **Logging and Status**:
   - All operations are logged for audit purposes
   - Status is tracked in `VERSION_PLAN.md`

This fully automated approach ensures consistent and reliable version management while eliminating the need for manual intervention during execution.

## 6. Does the workflow still use learn.log?

The updated `product_management.md` does not mention a `learn.log` file. Previous workflows stored learning notes in this log between phases, but its use is now optional.


## 7. Are the files mentioned in Q1 the only ones created by do_plan.md and create_version.md?

Yes, the files mentioned in Q1 represent a comprehensive list of all files and directories created by `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md`. The list in Q1 has been updated to include:

- Core documentation files (`VERSION_PLAN.md`, etc.)
- The copied template files (`create_version.md` in the version directory)
- Supporting directories (`docs/`, `testing/results/`)
- Configuration files (copied or created during initialization)

The files listed under "Referenced and Updated Files" in Q1 (such as `.github/workflows/`, `.gitignore`, and `CHANGELOG.md`) are not created by these templates but are only referenced or updated during the process.

This distinction between "created" files and "referenced/updated" files is important for understanding the scope and impact of the automated version management process.

## 8. Which files are referenced in the workflow but not created by do_plan.md or create_version.md?

The following files are referenced in the workflow but not created by either `do_plan.md` or `create_version.md`:

### Project Files Referenced But Not Created:
1. `ROADMAP.md` - Referenced extensively for version planning and status tracking.
2. `content/Style.md` - Referenced for McKinsey presentation standards and styling guidelines.
3. Project source code files directly modified by `create_version.md`:
   - `index.html` - Main HTML file, modified for slide content and structure.
   - `src/js/script.js` - Primary JavaScript file, potentially modified for slide logic (if active).
   - `src/js/main.js` - Alternative JavaScript file, potentially modified for slide logic.
   - `README.md` (project root) - Overall project documentation, may be updated with high-level changes.
4. The template files themselves (source of the planning process):
   - `plans/_templates/create_version.md` - Referenced and copied.
   - `plans/_templates/do_plan.md` - Referenced (executed).
   - `plans/_templates/finish_version.md` - Referenced and copied.
5. Version control and CI/CD files (referenced or updated as part of broader project context):
   - `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions.
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration.
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history (updated with new version details).

### Additional Notes

The updated guide no longer references a dedicated `learn.log` file. Earlier templates used this log to capture learning and reflection at each phase. Teams may still record insights if desired, but it is not required.
