## 3. What are the phases in create_version.md?


`create_version.md` contains the following 4 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Comprehensive Planning & Design (Automated)**
   - Version information extraction from ROADMAP.md
   - Standard files setup in the version directory
   - Automated task list generation in TASKS.md
   - Validation of requirements and dependencies

2. **Phase 2: Development Kickoff**
   - Milestone review and validation
   - Team assignments from the configuration file
   - Development environment verification
   - Documentation of development standards

3. **Phase 3: Iterative Feature Development & Implementation**
   - Code impact analysis with granular task creation
   - Implementation of tasks from TASKS.md
   - HTML and JavaScript updates for slides
   - Verification of slide architecture and navigation

4. **Phase 4: Holistic Review, Testing, Documentation & Finalization**
   - Comprehensive code review and testing
   - Batch update of documentation and release notes
   - Final validation of HTML structure and navigation
   - Updating ROADMAP.md and CHANGELOG.md

Each phase includes:
- Required file updates
- Progress tracking in TASKS.md
- Learning capture for continuous improvement
- Documentation updates
- Automated logging to learn.log

## 4. Are the tasks in tasks.md that create_version.md creates executed?

Yes, tasks in `tasks.md` are executed during Phase 3 (Implementation) of `create_version.md`. Here's how it works:

1. **Task Generation**
   - Tasks are defined in `TASKS.md` during earlier phases
   - Each task is tracked by status
   - Tasks reference requirements and specifications in `TECH_SPEC.md`

2. **Task Execution**
   - Tasks are executed in the order they appear in `tasks.md`
   - Updates to task status are made upon completion
   - Progress is tracked throughout the implementation

3. **Verification**
   - Code changes are verified against requirements
   - Slide ID and numbering consistency is checked
   - Changes are committed with descriptive messages

4. **Status and Logging**
   - Task status and overall progress are tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Execution details and issues are logged in `learn.log`
   - Both files are updated during implementation

5. **HTML Structure Verification**
   - Slide structure is verified for consistency
   - Navigation elements are tested
   - Image paths are checked for correctness

This ensures that all tasks are executed in a controlled and verifiable manner, focusing on the HTML application structure and content.

## 5. Is the first task to be executed the one that lists all code that will be changed by the subsequent tasks?

Yes, a critical early task, referred to as "Initial Code Analysis" (and specified as "Code Impact Analysis" in the template), performed during **Phase 1 (Comprehensive Planning & Design (Automated))** of `create_version.md`, is designed to analyze and document required code changes. This analysis task is part of the implementation phase as follows:

1.  **Initial Code Analysis / Code Impact Analysis**: This early task performs an analysis of the codebase to identify necessary changes specific to slide implementation, focusing on:
    *   HTML structure review
    *   Slide ID sequence verification
    *   Navigation button consistency
    *   Image path conventions

2.  **Documentation**: It documents the analysis results, including:
    *   Files requiring modification
    *   Specific changes needed
    *   Dependencies and impacts
    *   Slide architecture considerations

3.  **Task Generation**: Based on this analysis, `TASKS.md` is populated with granular tasks for the implementation phase, ensuring proper slide integration and consistency.

This approach ensures code changes are properly planned and documented before full implementation, providing a clear roadmap for the development process while focusing on the HTML-based slide architecture.

## 6. Can do_plan.md and create_version.md be executed by the AI without stopping for human approval or responses?

Yes, both `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` are designed to run automatically without requiring human intervention, provided that all prerequisites are met. Here's how automated execution works in the current implementation:

### Automated Execution Flow
1. **Pre-requisites**:
   - All required configuration values must be provided
   - `ROADMAP.md` must exist and be accessible
   - Required permissions for file operations must be set
   - HTML structure and slide architecture must be understood

2. **Non-Interactive Operation**:
   - Both files are designed to run without interactive input
   - All decisions are made based on predefined configuration
   - Error conditions are logged with appropriate messages
   - Focus is on HTML application modifications without deployment requirements

3. **Phase-based Execution**:
   - `create_version.md` follows a strict phase-based approach
   - Each phase validates its own requirements before proceeding
   - Status is tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Progress is logged for monitoring

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Non-critical issues are logged and execution continues
   - Critical errors stop execution and log detailed error information
   - Error recovery processes are built into each phase

5. **Logging and Status**:
   - All operations are logged for audit purposes
   - Status is tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Learnings are captured in `learn.log` for continuous improvement

This fully automated approach ensures consistent and reliable version management while eliminating the need for manual intervention during execution.

## 7. Where are learn.log used for logging in do_plan.md and create_version.md?

### learn.log Usage in current 4-phase implementation:

1. **In do_plan.md**:
   - Used to document key learnings during execution
   - Captured in the "Update Project Files" phase

2. **In create_version.md** (following its 4-phase operational model):
   - Captures learnings throughout the version creation process, recorded in `learn.log`.
   - **Phase 1 (Comprehensive Planning & Design - Automated):** While this phase doesn't have its own direct "Learning & Reflection" section, its learnings are conceptually captured and then explicitly appended to `learn.log` during Phase 2.
   - **Phase 2 (Development Kickoff):**
     - Appends learnings from Phase 1 to `learn.log`.
     - Appends its own "Phase 2 Learnings" (from its "Learning & Reflection" section) to `learn.log`.
   - **Phase 3 (Iterative Feature Development & Implementation):**
     - Allows for *brief, critical* learnings related to specific implementation challenges to be logged iteratively to `learn.log` as they occur.
     - A comprehensive summary of all Phase 3 learnings is deferred and logged by Phase 4.
   - **Phase 4 (Holistic Review, Testing, Documentation & Finalization):**
     - Appends a consolidated summary of all learnings from the entire Phase 3 to `learn.log`.
     - Appends its own "Phase 4 Learnings" (from its "Learning & Reflection" section) to `learn.log`.
   - Focus is on documenting code structure and HTML application modifications.

### Implementation Notes:
- `learn.log` is actively used for continuous improvement
- The log helps maintain context between different phases of execution
- Focus is on documenting code quality and HTML structure improvements
- Captures insights for slide architecture management and navigation consistency


## 8. Are the files mentioned in Q1 the only ones created by do_plan.md and create_version.md?

Yes, the files mentioned in Q1 represent a comprehensive list of all files and directories created by `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md`. The list in Q1 has been updated to include:

- Core documentation files (`VERSION_PLAN.md`, `TASKS.md`, etc.)
- The copied template files (`create_version.md` in the version directory)
- Supporting directories (`docs/`, `testing/results/`)
- Configuration files (copied or created during initialization)
- Log file (`learn.log`)

The files listed under "Referenced and Updated Files" in Q1 (such as `.github/workflows/`, `.gitignore`, and `CHANGELOG.md`) are not created by these templates but are only referenced or updated during the process.

This distinction between "created" files and "referenced/updated" files is important for understanding the scope and impact of the automated version management process.

---

## 9. Which files are referenced in the workflow but not created by do_plan.md or create_version.md?

The following files are referenced in the workflow but not created by either `do_plan.md` or `create_version.md`:

### Project Files Referenced But Not Created:
1. `ROADMAP.md` - Referenced extensively for version planning and status tracking.
2. `content/Style.md` - Referenced for McKinsey presentation standards and styling guidelines.
3. Project source code files directly modified by `create_version.md`:
   - `index.html` - Main HTML file, modified for slide content and structure.
   - `src/js/script.js` - Primary JavaScript file, potentially modified for slide logic (if active).
   - `src/js/main.js` - Alternative JavaScript file, potentially modified for slide logic.
   - `README.md` (project root) - Overall project documentation, may be updated with high-level changes.
4. The template files themselves (source of the planning process):
   - `plans/_templates/create_version.md` - Referenced and copied.
   - `plans/_templates/do_plan.md` - Referenced (executed).
   - `plans/_templates/finish_version.md` - Referenced and copied.
5. Version control and CI/CD files (referenced or updated as part of broader project context):
   - `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions.
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration.
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history (updated with new version details).

### Clarification on Log Files:
- `learn.log` is created by the templates, not just referenced, so it is correctly listed in Q1 under "Log Files"

## 10. How does the learning and reflection mechanism work across phases in create_version.md?

`create_version.md` implements a continuous learning cycle across all phases:

1. **Learning at the End of Each Phase**:
   - Phases 2-4 include dedicated "Learning & Reflection" sections
   - Phase 1 has its learnings explicitly appended by Phase 2
   - Learnings are saved to `learn.log`
   - Structured format generally includes:
     - What Went Well
     - Challenges Faced
     - Key Insights

2. **Reading Learnings at Phase Start**:
   - Phases 2-4 include a "Learning from Previous Phases" section
   - Phase 4 also includes this placeholder section
   - References reading from `learn.log`
   - Placeholder: `[Previous phases' learnings will be automatically inserted here from learn.log]`

3. **Automated File Updates**:
   - All phases include appending to `learn.log` in their "File Updates" sections
   - Phase 1's learnings are explicitly appended by Phase 2
   - Example: `Append Phase X learnings to learn.log`

4. **Varied but Consistent Structure**:
   - Core learning capture and logging mechanisms are present for all phases
   - The pattern of reading and writing learnings is maintained throughout
   - Creates a feedback loop between phases

5. **Implementation**:
   - Learnings are timestamped and categorized by phase
   - The system maintains a running log in `learn.log`
   - Each phase builds upon learnings from previous ones

This mechanism ensures knowledge is captured, stored, and applied throughout the version management process, creating a continuous improvement cycle.
