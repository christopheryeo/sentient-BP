## 4. Technical Design
### Architecture
- The Management Team section will be a new HTML structure within the existing `index.html` or a dedicated HTML file if modularity is preferred.
- CSS will be used for styling, potentially in a separate `team.css` file or integrated into the main stylesheet.
- JavaScript may be used for interactive elements like expandable bios.

### Data Model
- Team member data (name, title, bio, image path) will likely be structured in an array of objects within a JavaScript file or directly in HTML.

### API Changes
- No external API calls are anticipated for this feature.

## 5. User Experience
### Wireframes/Mockups
- Refer to `design.md` for detailed wireframes and visual design.
- General concept: A grid or row-based layout of team member "cards". Each card shows a photo, name, and title. Clicking/tapping a card or a "Read More" button reveals the full bio.

### User Flows
1. User navigates to the Management Team slide/section.
2. User sees an overview of team members with photos, names, and titles.
3. User hovers over a team member's card, triggering a subtle visual effect.
4. User clicks on a "Read More" link/button or the card itself.
5. The detailed bio for the selected team member is displayed (e.g., in an expanded area or a modal).
6. User can close the detailed bio and view others.
