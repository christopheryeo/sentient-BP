## Alignment Review (Phase 3.1)
- **Date:** [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP]
- **Findings:**
    - All tasks currently listed in `TASKS.md` for V0.2.6 ("Company Facts Slide") align with the objectives in `VERSION_PLAN.md` and the requirements outlined in `TECH_SPEC.md`.
    - Technical requirements from `TECH_SPEC.md` (derived from `ROADMAP.md`) appear to be covered by the generated placeholder implementation tasks.
    - No misalignments or gaps identified for the "Company Facts Slide" feature.
- **Recommendations:**
    - Proceed with implementation as tasks are aligned with plan and specifications.

## Deployment Checklist (Generated in Phase 5)

- [X] Task 6.2: Update `ROADMAP.md` status to 'Completed'. (Done in this phase)
- [X] Task 6.3: Add `CHANGELOG.md` entry. (Done in this phase)

## Rollback Procedures (Generated in Phase 5)
1.  **Identify Failure:** Determine if rollback is necessary based on failed deployment, critical smoke test failures, or immediate severe issues post-deployment.
2.  **Decision:** Deployment team lead to make the call for rollback.
3.  **Communication:** Notify stakeholders of rollback.
4.  **Execution (Simulated - for a static site, this might mean reverting a commit and redeploying):**
    - Revert the deployment commit(s) related to V0.2.6 from the main branch.
    - Redeploy the previous stable version of the application/website.
    - Verify successful rollback to the previous state.
5.  **Post-Rollback:**
    - Communicate rollback completion.
    - Investigate root cause of the deployment failure.
    - Update `TASKS.md` and `learn.log` with rollback details.
