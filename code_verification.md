## 2. Do the files do_plan.md and create_version.md read information from the file questions.md?

Yes, both `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` extensively interact with `questions.md` as follows:

### In do_plan.md:
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Requires pre-populated `questions.md` with version information
   - Loads and parses YAML configuration from `questions.md`
   - Creates a default `questions.md` if missing

2. **Execution**
   - Uses answers from `questions.md` during version creation
   - Validates all required information is present in `questions.md`
   - Verifies `questions.md` is complete before execution

3. **Pre-requisites**
   - `questions.md` must be fully populated before execution
   - Used as the single source of truth for version configuration

### In create_version.md:
1. **Default Values**
   - Reads values from `questions.md` as defaults
   - Uses these values throughout the version creation process

2. **Documentation**
   - Updates files like `TECH_SPEC.md` with specifications from `questions.md`
   - Uses team member information from `questions.md`

3. **Automation**
   - Gathers required information from `questions.md` and `ROADMAP.md`
   - Uses values from `questions.md` as defaults throughout the process

### Key Points:
- `questions.md` serves as the primary configuration file
- Both files require `questions.md` to be properly formatted and complete
- The file is used to maintain consistency across the version creation process
- Values from `questions.md` are used to populate various documentation files

## 3. What are the phases in create_version.md?

`create_version.md` contains the following 6 phases:

1. **Phase 1: Planning & Design (Automated)**
   - Version information extraction from ROADMAP.md
   - Standard files setup (README.md, design.md, tech-spec.md, etc.)

## 4. Are the tasks in tasks.md that create_version.md creates executed?

Yes, tasks in `tasks.md` are executed during Phase 3 (Implementation) of `create_version.md`. Here's how it works:

1. **Task Generation**
   - Tasks are defined in `TASKS.md` during earlier phases
   - Each task is tracked by status
   - Tasks reference requirements and specifications in `TECH_SPEC.md`

2. **Task Execution**
   - Tasks are executed in the order they appear in `tasks.md`
   - Updates to task status are made upon completion
   - Progress is tracked throughout the implementation

3. **Verification**
   - Code changes are verified against requirements
   - Slide ID and numbering consistency is checked
   - Changes are committed with descriptive messages

4. **Status and Logging**
   - Task status and overall progress are tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Execution details and issues are logged in `learn.log`
   - Both files are updated during implementation

5. **HTML Structure Verification**
   - Slide structure is verified for consistency
   - Navigation elements are tested
   - Image paths are checked for correctness

This ensures that all tasks are executed in a controlled and verifiable manner, focusing on the HTML application structure and content.

## 5. Is the first task to be executed the one that lists all code that will be changed by the subsequent tasks?

Yes, a critical early task, "Initial Code Analysis" performed during **Phase 3 (Implementation)** of `create_version.md`, is designed to analyze and document required code changes. This analysis task is part of the implementation phase as follows:

1. **Initial Code Analysis**: This early task performs an analysis of the codebase to identify necessary changes specific to slide implementation, focusing on:
   * HTML structure review
   * Slide ID sequence verification
   * Navigation button consistency
   * Image path conventions

2. **Documentation**: It documents the analysis results, including:
   * Files requiring modification
   * Specific changes needed
   * Dependencies and impacts
   * Slide architecture considerations

3. **Task Execution**: Based on this analysis, the implementation proceeds with specific tasks focused on ensuring proper slide integration and consistency across the presentation structure.

This approach ensures code changes are properly planned and documented before full implementation, providing a clear roadmap for the development process while focusing on the HTML-based slide architecture.

## 6. Can do_plan.md and create_version.md be executed by the AI without stopping for human approval or responses?

Yes, both `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md` are designed to run automatically without requiring human intervention, provided that all prerequisites are met. Here's how automated execution works in the current implementation:

### Automated Execution Flow
1. **Pre-requisites**:
   - `questions.md` must be fully populated with required information
   - `ROADMAP.md` must exist and be accessible
   - Required permissions for file operations must be set
   - HTML structure and slide architecture must be understood

2. **Non-Interactive Operation**:
   - Both files are designed to run without interactive input
   - All decisions are made based on the configuration in `questions.md`
   - Error conditions are logged with appropriate messages
   - Focus is on HTML application modifications without deployment requirements

3. **Phase-based Execution**:
   - `create_version.md` follows a strict phase-based approach
   - Each phase validates its own requirements before proceeding
   - Status is tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Progress is logged for monitoring

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Non-critical issues are logged and execution continues
   - Critical errors stop execution and log detailed error information
   - Error recovery processes are built into each phase

5. **Logging and Status**:
   - All operations are logged for audit purposes
   - Status is tracked in `TASKS.md`
   - Learnings are captured in `learn.log` for continuous improvement

This fully automated approach ensures consistent and reliable version management while eliminating the need for manual intervention during execution.

## 7. Where are learn.log used for logging in do_plan.md and create_version.md?

### learn.log Usage in current 6-phase implementation:

1. **In do_plan.md**:
   - Used to document key learnings during execution
   - Captured in the "Update Project Files" phase

2. **In create_version.md**:
   - Captures learnings throughout the version creation process
   - Each phase has its own Learning & Reflection section that contributes to learn.log:
      - Phase 1: Appends Planning & Design learnings
      - Phase 2: Appends Development Kickoff learnings
      - Phase 3: Appends Implementation learnings
      - Phase 4: Appends Code Review & Documentation learnings
      - Phase 5: Appends Final Verification learnings
      - Phase 6: Appends Implementation Review learnings
   - Focus is on documenting code structure and HTML application modifications

### Implementation Notes:
- `learn.log` is actively used for continuous improvement
- The log helps maintain context between different phases of execution
- Focus is on documenting code quality and HTML structure improvements
- Captures insights for slide architecture management and navigation consistency


## 8. Are the files mentioned in Q1 the only ones created by do_plan.md and create_version.md?

Yes, the files mentioned in Q1 represent a comprehensive list of all files and directories created by `do_plan.md` and `create_version.md`. The list in Q1 has been updated to include:

- Core documentation files (`VERSION_PLAN.md`, `TASKS.md`, etc.)
- The copied template files (`create_version.md` in the version directory)
- Supporting directories (`docs/`, `testing/results/`)
- Configuration files (`questions.md` - copied or created)
- Log file (`learn.log`)

The files listed under "Referenced and Updated Files" in Q1 (such as `.github/workflows/`, `.gitignore`, and `CHANGELOG.md`) are not created by these templates but are only referenced or updated during the process.

This distinction between "created" files and "referenced/updated" files is important for understanding the scope and impact of the automated version management process.

---

## 9. Which files are referenced in the workflow but not created by do_plan.md or create_version.md?

The following files are referenced in the workflow but not created by either `do_plan.md` or `create_version.md`:

### Project Files Referenced But Not Created:
1. `ROADMAP.md` - Referenced extensively for version planning and status tracking
2. `content/Style.md` - Referenced for McKinsey presentation standards and styling guidelines
3. The template files themselves:
   - `plans/_templates/create_version.md` - Referenced and copied, but the original template is not created
   - `plans/_templates/do_plan.md` - Referenced but not created by the workflow itself
   - `plans/_templates/questions.md` - Referenced and potentially copied if not existing
   - `plans/_templates/finish_version.md` - Referenced and copied (as completion_checklist.md), but the original template is not created
4. Version control files that are referenced and updated but not created:
   - `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions (referenced if configured)
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore configuration (referenced and potentially updated)
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Release history (referenced and updated with new versions)

### Clarification on Log Files:
- `learn.log` is created by the templates, not just referenced, so it is correctly listed in Q1 under "Log Files"

## 10. How does the learning and reflection mechanism work across phases in create_version.md?

`create_version.md` implements a continuous learning cycle across all phases:

1. **Learning at the End of Each Phase**:
   - Phases 2-6 include dedicated "Learning & Reflection" sections
   - Phase 1 has its learnings explicitly appended by Phase 2
   - Learnings are saved to `learn.log`
   - Structured format generally includes:
     - What Went Well
     - Challenges Faced
     - Key Insights

2. **Reading Learnings at Phase Start**:
   - Phases 2-5 include a "Learning from Previous Phases" section
   - Phase 6 also includes this placeholder section
   - References reading from `learn.log`
   - Placeholder: `[Previous phases' learnings will be automatically inserted here from learn.log]`

3. **Automated File Updates**:
   - All phases include appending to `learn.log` in their "File Updates" sections
   - Phase 1's learnings are explicitly appended by Phase 2
   - Example: `Append Phase X learnings to learn.log`

4. **Varied but Consistent Structure**:
   - Core learning capture and logging mechanisms are present for all phases
   - The pattern of reading and writing learnings is maintained throughout
   - Creates a feedback loop between phases

5. **Implementation**:
   - Learnings are timestamped and categorized by phase
   - The system maintains a running log in `learn.log`
   - Each phase builds upon learnings from previous ones

This mechanism ensures knowledge is captured, stored, and applied throughout the version management process, creating a continuous improvement cycle.
